  A Polynomial model.

description: |
  A polynomial model represented by its coefficients stored in
  an ndarray of shape (n+1,) for univariate polynomials or (n+1, n+1)
  for polynomials with 2 variables, where n is the highest total degree
  of the polynomial.

  :math:`P = \sum_{i, j=0}^{i+j=n}c_{i_j} * x^{i} * y^{j}`

examples:
  -
    - :math:`P = 1.2 + 0.3 * x + 56.1 * x^{2}`
