      tag:
        description: |
          A fully-qualfied YAML tag name that should be associated
          with the object type returned by the YAML parser; for
          example, the object must be an instance of the class
          registered with the parser to create instances of objects
          with this tag. Implementation of this validator is optional
          and depends on details of the YAML parser.

      propertyOrder:
        description: |
          Objects with a defined propertyOrder must be treated as an
          ordered mapping, and its keys must be in the same relative
          order they are listed in this validator. Keys listed in
          propertyOrder are not required to be present in the object,
          and any keys not specified by propertyOrder may come in
          arbitrary order so long as they follow any keys listed here.
